# Mobile Login UI/UX Design

Welcome to the Mobile Login UI/UX Design project! This repository contains the Figma design files for our mobile application's login and registration flow.

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a visually appealing and user-friendly design for a mobile application's login and registration process. The design includes three main screens: Welcome, Login Now, and Sign Up.

## Design Overview
- **Welcome Screen**: Prompts users to either log in or sign up. Provides options to enter via social networks (Facebook or Twitter) or email.
- **Login Now Screen**: Allows users to enter their credentials (email and password). Includes a 'Forgot the Password?' link and a prominent 'Login' button.
- **Sign Up Screen**: Contains fields for new users to input their name, email, and create a password. Offers a clear 'Sign Up' button for account creation.
